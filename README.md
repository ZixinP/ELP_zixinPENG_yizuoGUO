# Project ELP-GOlang : Digital image processing
## Extract contours from color images

In this project, we will realise un GO program that extract contours from color images.
To achieve this, we will firstly convert the color image into a grayscale image, and we will then applicate an algorithm that distinguish the contours. 
All the process will be runned as Goroutines which will divide the whole image into several section for trait, this will speed up the calculations.

**if we have time:** we can try to convert the image into certain art style basing on the contours.
